Introduction:
This report explains about free and an open-source software program that allows you to perform a comprehensive audit of your Windows computer's hardware and software configurations.

Objective of the project: 
To use any open-source software to collect detailed information about the computer's operating system, installed software, hardware components, and network settings, and to present the data in an easy-to-read report.

Description of the project:
WinAudit is easy to use and an open-source software.The program reports on virtually every aspect of computer inventory and configuration. Results are displayed in web-page format, categorised for ease of viewing and text searching. Whether your interest is in software compliance, hardware inventory, technical support, security or just plain curiosity, WinAudit has it all. The program has advanced features such as service tag detection, hard-drive failure diagnosis, network port to process mapping, network connection speed, system availability statistics as well as Windows update and firewall settings.

Scope of the project:
Download and install WinAudit: You can download WinAudit from the developer's website and install it on your Windows system.
Launch WinAudit: Once installed, launch WinAudit by double-clicking on the WinAudit.exe file.
Select the audit type: WinAudit offers several types of audits. Choose the audit type that meets your requirements. For example, you can select "Quick System Overview" to get a brief system summary, or "Full Audit" to gather detailed information about the system.
Configure the audit settings: Configure the audit settings based on your requirements. For example, you can choose to audit the entire system or specific areas like hardware, software, or user accounts.
Run the audit: Click on the "Start" button to begin the audit. The audit may take several minutes to complete, depending on the scope and complexity of the audit.
View the report: Once the audit is complete, WinAudit generates a report in the format you selected. You can view the report directly within the WinAudit interface or save it to a file for future reference.
Analyze the report: Use the report generated by WinAudit to analyze the system's configuration and identify any issues or areas for improvement.

Overall, WinAudit is a powerful tool that can provide a detailed and comprehensive view of your Windows-based system. By following these steps, you can use WinAudit to gather information about your system's configuration and make informed decisions about maintenance, security, and optimization.


Target system description:
The WinAudit is designed to audit and collect information from Windows-based computer systems. It can run on a variety of Windows operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
The software is capable of collecting information on a wide range of hardware components, including CPU, memory, storage devices, network adapters, and peripherals. It can also collect information about the operating system, including installed updates, running services, and system configuration settings.

Assumptions:
WinAudit assumes that the user has administrative privileges on the computer system being audited. Without administrative privileges, the software may not be able to access certain system files and registry entries, which could result in incomplete or inaccurate audit results.
Additionally, WinAudit assumes that the computer system being audited is running a Windows operating system. The software is not designed to audit other operating systems such as macOS or Linux.
Finally, WinAudit assumes that the computer system being audited is functioning properly and that all hardware components and software applications are installed and functioning correctly. If there are hardware or software issues, WinAudit may not be able to provide accurate information or may not be able to collect information at all.
Dependencies:
WinAudit has a few dependencies that need to be installed on the computer system before it can be run successfully. These dependencies include:
Microsoft .NET Framework: WinAudit requires .NET Framework to be installed on the computer system in order to run. The version of .NET Framework required by WinAudit varies depending on the version of Windows being used.
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: WinAudit requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package to be installed on the computer system in order to run.
WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation): WinAudit uses WMI to gather information about the computer system. WMI is included with all modern versions of Windows, but it must be enabled and running on the computer system for WinAudit to be able to access it.

Overall, these dependencies are typically pre-installed on most Windows-based computer systems, but it's important to ensure that they are up to date and properly configured in order to ensure that WinAudit runs smoothly and provides accurate audit results.
